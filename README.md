### What is Big Data?

### Big Data is everything collected from human activity in one large dataset. Human activity may include posting pictures on Instagram of your cat, posting a tweet about how you're feeling in the morning, or even posting a Video on YouTube about your vacations in Orlado, Fl. Big Data is everything people post and it gets collected on a dataset. 
In other words, it's human-centered activities. Or as Dr. Tsou says "Big Data is a large dynamic dataset created by or derived from human activities, communications, movements, and behaviors." (Tsou, 2015).
